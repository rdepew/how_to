Jeff,

Just like on any Unix system, "uname -srv" will return the kernel (in
Cygwin's case, cygwin1.dll) version.  On Cygwin, you can also use
"cygcheck -srv" to get detailed information about your system (essential
for diagnosing Cygwin problems, see <http://cygwin.com/problems.html>), or
"cygcheck -cd" to just get the versions of all installed packages (or omit
the "-d" flag to also check them for integrity).  If you post the output
of either "cygcheck -srv" or "cygcheck -cd", please *attach* it to your
message, rather than including it inline.

P.S. I was surprised that this isn't in the FAQ.  David, could you please
add this, under the heading "What version of Cygwin do I have?" or
something?  Oh, and BTW, there's a "What version is this, anyway?" entry
that has nothing to do with this question, and is pretty confusing.
