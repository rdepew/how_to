I can't believe I didnt' figure this out before.

You know how the Windows C:\ drive maps to /cygwin/c? Well, where do network 
drives map to?

I found the answer on 
https://superuser.com/questions/102233/how-to-go-to-remote-directory-in-cygwin

The Windows network location
  \\files.somewhere.com\smbshare\xyzzy
maps to the Cygwin location
  //files.somewhere.com/smbshare/xyzzy. 

Everything's the same, except that you use forward slashes instead of
backslashes. Easy peasy. Like I said, how come I didn't figure this out
before?

Duh.
