Using ps -ef
------------
To see all Cygwin processes running:
     ps -ef
To see all Windows processes running:
     ps -W
(That last one is cool!)

Looking for something like the Windows TaskManager?
Try one of these:
     tasklist (Windows command - try tasklist /? )
     top (cygwin's is a beautiful color version)
     htop (a new and improved version - not on Cygwin yet)
