# how_to

Short "how-to" files on various computer, SW dev, and OS topics


## What's in here

You know how you learn little tricks of the trade while you're
working with a particular hardware platform (such as Raspberry Pi),
OS (such as Windows or Linux), development system (such as Visual
Studio) or application (such as Word or LaTeX)?

Yeah.

Well, rather than search the Web yet again for that thing I learned 
months ago and have since forgotten, I created a short library of
"how-to" guides for myself. Someone asked for a copy of the library
so I obliged them. Then someone else asked for a copy of it, so I 
realized it was time to put it in a more accessible place.

Therefore, Github.

This also allows me to copy the library to a new computer, quickly
and easily.


## Intended audience

Me. But if you find it useful, great. If you don't find it
useful, I don't care.


## .TXT versus .MD format

Files that end in .TXT are simple text files.

Files that end in .MD are Markdown files. They read just like
simple text files, but if you open them in a browser, they 
will have bold print, headings and subheadings, and so on. If 
you open them in an editor like Vim or Notepad++, 
you will have different colored text according to whether it's
bold, headings and subheadings, and so on.

## Suggestions and enhancement requests

This isn't intended to sound snobby, but you know, on the highway
of life, you can only drive your own car. Rather than forward
suggestions or enhancement requests to me, I suggest that you create
your own `$HOME/Documents/how_to` library and fill it with content
tailored specifically for *you*.

If that's too much work, then create a fork of this repo and add 
your own stuff to it.

And no, I'm not loosening permissions so that you can push stuff to 
my repo.


## Mistakes, errors, updates, and corrections

I feel the same way about corrections. I'd prefer to find out
for myself that something doesn't work anymore, rather than have it
pointed out to me. Anybody who has been married for more than ten 
years knows what I'm talking about.

To reword what I said earlier, only you can drive your car. Any errors
in here are mine. All mine. I own them!
