Compiling with a makefile
=========================

Suppose you have a file hello.c, and you want to compile it with gcc.

If you were to do it from a command line, you would type:

    gcc hello.c -o hello

With a makefile, you simply type 

    make hello

and it does it for you. Here's how: Create a file called 'makefile' in 
the same directory as your source code. Here's all it has to have inside:

-------------- cut here - begin makefile contents ------
hello: hello_world.c
	gcc hello_world.c -o hello

-------------- cut here - end makefile contents ------

That's all there is to it. If your command shell program can't find gcc, 
you'll need to replace 'gcc' with the full pathname to gcc.exe.

Now you can make sure that the hello.exe executable always matches the
hello.c source by typing 

    make hello

in the appropriate directory. If hello.c is newer than hello.exe, make 
will update the .exe for you.
