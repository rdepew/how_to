Counting files in a directory
=============================

This includes subdirectories, of course.

Tree
----

Just run the 'tree' command. The bottom line (literally) tells you how many directories and how many files it found.


Ls
--

The command
```
ls -laR | egrep -c'^-'
```
... gives you an integer, the number of files it found. The 'a' ("all") option includes hidden files in the count.
The 'R' ("recursive") option includes all subdirectories in the directory tree.

To see how it works, try the 'ls -laR' command without piping it to 'egrep'.
