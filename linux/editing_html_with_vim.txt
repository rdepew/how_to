Editing HTML with VIM
=====================

This also works for XML.

To select everything between two tags, like these div tags:

  <div class="container">
    stuff
    more stuff
    yet more stuff
    all kinds of stuff
  </div>

Type v a t (visual, all, tags) to highlight everything including the tags.
or
Type v i t (visual, inside, tags) to highlight everything between the tags.

With everything highlighted, type o repeatedly to toggle between the tags.
(Normally, 'o' does a 'add a line underneath the cursor' action.)

Type c i t (change, inside, tags) to change everything between the tags.
