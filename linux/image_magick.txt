Using ImageMagick to convert between graphics formats
=====================================================

Like pandoc, ImageMagick is a command-line-only tool.
(Actually, that's no longer true. But let's pretend it is.)

On Ubuntu, ImageMagick is invoked using the 'convert' command.
On some other systems, it is invoked using the 'magick' command.

Try 'convert --help | less' to see how to use it, or go to the
website, <https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>
or, more specifically,
<https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php>.
