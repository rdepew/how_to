# Reading formatted JSON in Notepad++ or Vim

## Notepad++

JSON files are usually just one long line with no newlines or indents. I
manually formatted them last week. That's too much work.

Notepad++ has a Plugin Manager. Using the Plugin Manager, I added JSTool and
JSON Viewer plugins to Notepad++ at home. Having both is redundant. Just JSTool
would have been enough. But yeah: add them at work.


## Vim

From inside VIM, you can call on a Python plugin to do the same thing for you:
```
:%!python -m json.tool
```

I got the VIM tip from https://coderwall.com/p/faceag/format-json-in-vim.  He
referenced
https://blog.realnitro.be/2010/12/20/format-json-in-vim-using-pythons-jsontool-module/.
And *he* referenced
http://visibletrap.blogspot.com/2010/05/vim-how-to-format-and-syntax-highlight.html,
which also tells how to turn it into one of Steve's "leader" commands.  And
*he* referenced a page that is no longer found, dating from 2009. Nothing is
new, is it?

"Leader" is explained in
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764263/what-is-the-leader-in-a-vimrc-file
. It defaults to backslash. This means I need to brush up on .vimrc files.


## Standalone (and also VIM method 2)

Install the tool 'jq'. 
```
$ sudo apt install jq
```

Use the package manager for Cygwin or MobaXterm.

From the command line, execute this command.
```
jq . <filename>.json
```

Output goes to stdout. The dot is important. Don't neglect it.

From inside VIM:
```
:%!jq .
```

Remember, the dot is important. Don't neglect it.
