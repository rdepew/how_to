Using pandoc to turn Markdown into HTML
=======================================

Note that pandoc is much more versatile than this simple task.
It can convert between multiple file formats, not just Markdown
and HTML. See <https://pandoc.org> for more details.

1. Create the .md file.

2. Open a Windows PowerShell. Navigate to the directory
  containing the .md file.

3. In PowerShell, execute the command
```
pandoc -s -o <filename>.html <filename>.md
```
  * The -s tells pandoc to create a full standalone webpage, 
    not just an HTML fragment (that is, just the text in the .md
    file).
  * The -o argument specifies the output filename.
  * The final argument is the input filename.

4. In Firefox or Google Chrome, press Ctl-O, navigate to the
  directory containing the .html file, and select the .html file.
