# How to find out who's using a port

There's a bunch of different commands. To really understand them,
read the manpages.

Make sure you use them with the suggested parameters/options, or
modify the options to your liking. Using them without any options
can give you way more output than you wanted.

```
netstat -ltp
# To check on a particular port number, like 8080 in this example:
netstat -ltpn | grep -w ':80'

ss -ta
# or 
ss -lta

lsof -i :80
```
