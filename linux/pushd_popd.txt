pushd and popd
==============

Linux (and Windows PowerShell) use a directory stack. It's always there,
but most users ignore it, and just use 'cd' instead. I mean, 'cd' is
powerful and versatile, too. But this is about the directory stack.

Three commands:
* pushd
* popd
* dirs

pushd
-----
pushd [dir] changes to 'dir', puts 'dir' on the top of the directory
stack, and prints the directory stack for you.

popd
----
popd deletes the entry on the top of the directory stack, changes to the
previous directory on the stack, and prints the directory stack for you.

dirs
----
dirs prints the directory stack for you.

pushd +n
--------
It looks like 'pushd +1' is equivalent to 'cd -'. 

popd +n
-------
I haven't experimented with this yet.
