SD cards and Linux
==================

It's a lot easier to format and partition SD cards in Windows, but
sometimes you get an SD card from someone and it has multiple partitions
and some of the partitions are empty or unused.

Or sometimes your network connections in Windows are such that Disk
Management and diskpart and chkdsk don't work. 

Here are some Linux commands that will help.

Seeing all of the disks you have
--------------------------------

Disks show up as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, and so on. Partitions on disks show up
as /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and so on.

Here are some useful commands for seeing the disks (including SD cards) on
your system:

    df (not terribly useful for seeing or recovering bad SD cards)
    sudo fdisk -l
    lsblk

Using partition editor tools
----------------------------

The two most common tools are 'parted' and the graphical version,
'gPartEd'. (I may have the CamelCase wrong on that one.)

Here are some useful tutorials on 'parted':

Here's the GNU Parted manual
https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/parted.html#Using-Parted-1

Here's what I had to do to clean up an SD card. It wasn't painful, once I
got it all figured out.

First, start parted by typing 'parted' at the command line. It gives you a
new command line with a '(parted)' prompt.

Select the right device. You have to use df, fdisk -l, or lsblk to find the
devices. DON'T SELECT THE WRONG ONE!

    select /dev/sdb

Print the card and partition info so you know what you need to do

    print

Now remove all of the partitions. I did them in reverse order, but I don't
think you have to.

    rm 5
    rm 4
    rm 3 
    rm 2
    rm 1

Create one huge partition for the entire card.

    mkpart primary fat32 0 100%

Verify that it worked, then exit.

    print
    quit


Mounting the SD card
--------------------

For some reason, this part has always made me nervous. Basically, it's
two steps. In this example, we're going to mount the partition located at
/dev/sdc1 and call it /mnt/data. Then we can use /mnt/data just like any
other Linux directory.

    mkdir /mnt/data
    mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/data

You can list the contents of /dev/sdc1:

    ls /mnt/data

To unmount (eject) the SD card:

    umount /mnt/data (that's 'umount', not 'unmount')
