SSH and VNC
===========

ssh
---

To use SSH on a Linux box, you need to install openssh.
In order to ssh to the Linux box from another machine, you'll need to:
    sudo apt install openssh-server
on the Linux box.
In order to ssh from the Linux box to another machine, you'll need to:
    sudo apt install openssh-client
on the Linux box.

To SSH from one machine to a machine with the IP address 192.168.10.10:
    ssh 192.168.10.10

If your /etc/hosts file lists a alias for the IP address, you can use the alias
instead:
    ssh oem-nuc

vnc
---

To use VNC on a Linux box, you need to install a VNC server on the remote 
machine (the machine you want to see) and a VNC viewer or VNC client on
the local machine (the machine with the keyboard and display).

X11 has a decent VNC server. To install it:
    sudo apt intall x11vnc
To start the server on the remote machine:
    x11vnc -display :0

Then, on the local machine:
    vncviewer <remote_machine_ip_address>:0
