How to create and copy SSH keys
===============================

You set up computers for SSH'ing by (1) creating a public key and a private
key, and (2) by copying the public key to the other computer. Best to explain
by quoting from
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/device-tester-for-greengrass-ug.html:

Adding Authorized SSH Keys to Your Device Under Test
----------------------------------------------------

AWS IoT Device Tester must use your SSH private key to sign in to your device
under test. To authorize your SSH private key to sign in to your device under
test, use the ssh-copy-id command from your host computer. This command adds
your public key into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on your device under test.
For example:

    $ ssh-copy-id<remote-ssh-user>@<remote-device-ip>

Where remote-ssh-user is the user name used to sign in to your device under
test and remote-device-ip is the IP address of the device under test to run
tests against. For example:

    ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.1.5

When prompted, enter the password for the user name you specified in the
ssh-copy-id command.

ssh-copy-id assumes the public key is named id_rsa.pub and is stored the
default location (on macOS and Linux, ~/.ssh/ and on Windows,
C:\Users\<user-name>\.ssh). If you gave the public key a different name or
stored it in a different location, you must specify the fully qualified path to
your SSH public key using the -i option to ssh-copy-id (for example,
ssh-copy-id -i ~/my/path/myKey.pub). For more information about creating SSH
keys and copying public keys, see SSH-COPY-ID.
