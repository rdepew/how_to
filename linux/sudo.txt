If you don't want to have to type your user password every time you 
use a 'sudo' command, then do this:

    sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>

Sign out and then sign back in for changes to take effect.

Verify that it worked by doing this:

    sudo echo test

If the system does NOT prompt you for a password, and DOES return
'test', then your user is configured correctly.
