Using a thumb drive
===================

1. Find out what device (like /dev/sdc1) your thumb drive is using:
     lsblk
2. Mount the thumb drive. That takes two commands:
    sudo mkdir /media/usb
    sudo mnt /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
3. Do all your stuff.
4. Before removing the thumb drive, unmount it:
    sudo umount /media/usb
