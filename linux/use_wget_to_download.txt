Use 'wget' to download stuff from the Web
=========================================
Use the ‘wget’ function to download stuff from the web without a browser.

It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. If downloading webpages, it can do everything
you need to create a local version of the webpage, including links and images.

‘wget’ is a fire-and-forget function, so that you can launch it and then log
out. As long as you don’t shut down or reboot, it will run to completion
without you.
