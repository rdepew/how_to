# VIM tricks

## Editing multiple files

1. The simplest way to edit multiple files is with the command 
  `vi file1 file2 ...`
  Then use the Vi commands :n and :p to switch between them.
  :n is "go to next file". :p is "go to previous file".

2. To edit multiple files with tabs at the top of the window
  (my personal favorite), use the `-p` option:
  `vi -p file1 file2 ...`
  Then use the key combinations `gt` and `gT` to switch 
  forward and backward through the tabs. 

3. To edit multiple files side-by-side in a big window, use 
  the '-O' option (that's a capital oh, not a zero):
  `vi -O file1 file2 ...`
  This works best if you have a very wide terminal window.

  To edit multiple files arranged vertically in a big window,
  use the '-o' option (that's a small oh):
  `vi -o file1 file2 ...`
  This works best if you have a very tall terminal window.

  Then use the key combinations `Ctl-W w` `Ctl-W j` and 
  `Ctl-W k` to switch between files.

  To open a new file beside the others:
  :new foofoofoo

  To show only the file you're currently in:
  :only

  To exit from any one file and close its window:
  :q

  To exit from all files at once:
  :qa

## Code folding

"Code folding" is when you collapse a block of code into one line.
It's used in IDEs like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, and in
other editors like Notepad++. It requires the editor to have some
knowledge of code syntax.

Use "z" commands to manage the code blocks.

NOTE: I've only done this using the Vim extension in VSCode. I don't
know whether native Vim supports code folding in this way. A web
search turns up many other ways to skin the code-folding cat.


### To collapse a code block

VSCode marks code blocks with a thin vertical line on the left of 
the code block. To collapse the block,
position the cursor anywhere in the block and use the command
`z c`
Think of the `c` as "collapse" or "close".

### To expand a code block

VSCode marks collapsed code blocks with a greater-than sign ">" 
on the left, and an ellipsis "..." on the right. To expand the 
block, position the cursor anywhere on the >line... and use 
the command
`z o`
Think of the `o` as "open". 

In the paradigm of VSCode's Vim plugin, you "close" and "open"
a code block; hence, `c` and `o`.

### Other commands for working with folds

* `[ z` Jump to the beginning of a fold
* `] z` Jump to the end of a fold
* `z m` Increase the fold level by one
* `z r` Decrease the fold level by one
* `z O` (that's a capital O) Open all folds at the cursor
* `z M` (that's a capital M) Close all open folds
* `z R` (that's a capital R) Decrease the fold level to 
  zero -- all folds will be open
