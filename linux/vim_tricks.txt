# VIM tricks

# Editing multiple files

1. The simplest way to edit multiple files is with the command 
  `vi file1 file2 ...`
  Then use the Vi commands :n and :p to switch between them.
  :n is "go to next file". :p is "go to previous file".

2. To edit multiple files with tabs at the top of the window
  (my personal favorite), use the `-p` option:
  `vi -p file1 file2 ...`
  Then use the key combinations `gt` and `gT` to switch 
  forward and backward through the tabs. 

3. To edit multiple files side-by-side in a big window, use 
  the '-O' option (that's a capital oh, not a zero):
  `vi -O file1 file2 ...`
  This works best if you have a very wide terminal window.

  To edit multiple files arranged vertically in a big window,
  use the '-o' option (that's a small oh):
  `vi -o file1 file2 ...`
  This works best if you have a very tall terminal window.

  Then use the key combinations `Ctl-W w` `Ctl-W j` and 
  `Ctl-W k` to switch between files.

  To open a new file beside the others:
  :new foofoofoo

  To show only the file you're currently in:
  :only

  To exit from any one file and close its window:
  :q

  To exit from all files at once:
  :qa
