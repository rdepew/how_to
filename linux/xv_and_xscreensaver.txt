XV and XScreenSaver
===================

First, XScreenSaver is the old X11-based screensaver program. Still superior to
a lot of alternatives. You can install it using
```
sudo apt install xscreensaver
```

Second, XV is an old, old, OLD image viewer written by John Bradley and
abandoned (not maliciously) by him in 1994. The online community has continued
to update it. YOu can obtain it from https://snapcraft.io/xv . I used to use
this at HP, back when I first learned Unix. It's a great little program.

Actually, it took me two -- no, four -- steps to install xv on a Raspberry Pi 3.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
sudo reboot
sudo snap install core
sudo snap install xv --edge
```

And for Raspberry Pi, I had to modify that last command one more time:
```
sudo snap install xv --edge --jailmode
```

UPDATE 20200819: Forget XV. Okay, it's still good, but ImageMagick is better.
Install ImageMagick instead, and then use the 'display' command instead of
'xv'.
```
sudo apt install imagemagick
display --help
display (with no arguments at all)
display show_this_file.jpg
```
