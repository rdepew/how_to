# Copying folders or multiple files in PowerShell

Actually, this is for DOS. It works with all DOS clones, including
FreeDOS and Wine.

## xcopy

The first, and oldest, command is `xcopy`. To see how it works, execute
```
xcopy /?
```
at the command prompt.

# robocopy

According to Wikipedia, starting in Windows 10, `xcopy` is still available
but is deprecated in favor of `robocopy`. To see how it works, execute
```
robocopy /?
```
at the command prompt.

Judging from the '/?' output, robocopy looks more powerful and also 
easier to use.
