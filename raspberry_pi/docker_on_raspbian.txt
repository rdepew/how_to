# Installing Docker on Raspbian

You have to use Raspbian Stretch or newer.

Follow the instructions at https://withblue.ink/2017/12/31/yes-you-can-run-docker-on-raspbian.html. You will run into a couple of problems at the very end.

To avoid tehse problems, run these commands *BEFORE* the `pip install docker-compose` step.
```
pip install setuptools
pip install wheel
apt (or sudo apt) install python-dev libffi-dev
```
