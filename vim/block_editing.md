# Block editing in Vim

This requires you to use visual mode.

Well, look at this website: https://opensource.com/article/19/2/getting-started-vim-visual-mode

From that source:

## To indent a set of lines

* Press Shift+V to enter Line mode. The words VISUAL LINE will appear
  at the bottom of the screen.
* Use navigation commands, like arrow keys, to highlight multiple lines
  of text.
* Use the > or < keys to move the text right or left.

Other commands, like 'd' to delete (and then you can move someplace and
'p' to put), also work.
