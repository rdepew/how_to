# VIM Plugins

## Plug-in Manager

The plug-in manager is *vim-plug*. Search for it online. You have to install
it first, then you add the list of plugins to the .vimrc file.

## EasyMotion

*vim-easymotion* is the plugin that Steve McKown introduced to me. It lets
you move around easily. The leader key is still backslash. However, now,
to activate EasyMotion, you need to press leader TWICE, then you add a
modifier, like w for words-forward or b for words-backward.

## Fuzzy Finder

*fzf* is the Fuzzy Finder. Learn more about it.

## Vim-commentary

*vim-commentary* is a tool that lets you comment or uncomment one or more
lines at a time. It'll also do inline comments, and I think it will wrap
just part of a line in comments, as well. AND if you type, like "TODO" on
a bunch of lines, you can then go back and comment all of the "TODO" lines
at once.

## Targets.vim

*targets.vim* adds a bunch more editing tools. I think this is the one
that lets you highlight all occurrences of "foo" and edit them at one
time. It also adds things like "delete everything inside the next set of
single quotes".

## LightLine

*lightline.vim* is a lightweight replacement for the status line. No more
Ctl-G to see what you're editing or where you are.
