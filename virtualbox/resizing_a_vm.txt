Resizing an Oracle VirtualBox virtual machine
=============================================

This procedure makes the following important assumptions:

1. Your host computer, the one running VirtualBox, is running  Windows 10.
2. Your VirtualBox version is 6.1 or newer.
3. Your virtual machine is a Linux machine.

Preliminaries
-------------

Before you can resize the VM, you need to clone the original VM. 

And before you can clone it, you should update PATH environmental variable
on your Windows host.

And before you can update the PATH, you need to verify the path to VirtualBox.

Verify the path
---------------

Open a File Manager window.

Double-click "Local Disk (C:)".

Double-click "Program Files". Look for a directory called "Oracle". If it's
not there, back up one level and double-click "Program Files (x86)" instead.

Double-click "Oracle". Look for a directory called "VirtualBox".

Double-click "VirtualBox". Look for a file called "VBoxManage.exe". If you 
can find that file, then you're in the right place.

At the top of the File Manager window is a box that says "Program Files > 
Oracle > VirtualBox", or something similar. 

Single-click the box, and it changes to "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox".
Right-click and select Copy.

Update PATH
------------

Click the Start icon, the Settings icon (the gear) to open the 
"Windows Settings" window. In the "Find a setting" box, type PATH.

Choose "Edit the system environment variables".

In the "System Properties" window, click "Environment Variables...".

In the "User Variables for whatsyourname" list, click Path, and then click
"Edit...".

The "Edit environment variable" window opens up. Click "New".

On the line below the last entry in the window, right-click and select
Paste. This will add the path to VirtualBox, from the previous step,
to the bottom of the list.

Click OK to close the "Edit environment variable" window.

Click OK to close the "Environment Variables" window.

Click OK to close the "System Properties" window.

Close the "Windows Settings" window.


Clone the VM
------------

Click the Start icon or the "Type here to search" window in the menu bar.

Type "command" but don't hit Enter. Right click on either of the "Command
Prompt App" offerings, and select "Run as administrator." This opens a
"Adminstrator: Command Prompt" window.

Let's assume for this example that your username is "mike" and your VM
machine is "machine1".

At the C:\> prompt, type the command
    cd "\Users\mike\VirtualBox VMs"
and press Enter. This will put you in the "VirtualBox VMs" directory and the 
prompt will change to "C:\Users\mike\VirtualBox VMs>" .

Type the command
    dir
and press Enter to confirm that there's a directory called "machine1".

Type the commands
    cd machine1
    dir
pressing Enter after each command, to confirm that you're in the "machine1" 
directory and that, among the other files in the directory, is a file called
"machine1.vdi".

Type the command
    path
and press Enter, to confirm that "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox" is 
in the PATH variable.

Now you're FINALLY ready to clone the VM. Carefully type the command
    VBoxManage clonemedium disk machine1.vdi machine2.vdi
and press Enter. Watch the command output to verify that the VDI file is
cloned.

"Cloned" is more than "copied". You have to clone it.

Now you have a new VM image, called "machine2.vdi". This is the one you're 
going to resize. Don't touch "machine1.vdi"; leave it there as a backup.

Resize the VM (the easy way, using the VirtualBox tool)
-------------------------------------------------------

Open the Oracle VM VirtualBox app. In the File menu at the top, click
Virtual Media Manager. You should see both machine1.vdi and machine2.vdi
listed in the Virtual Media Manager window.

Don't touch machine1.vdi. Remember, it's now your backup.

Click machine2.vdi. Then, in the bottom of the window, adjust the size. You
can make the VM bigger, but you can't make it smaller.

Click Apply. That's it! Your new VM image is now resized. Don't open it
yet -- but if you tried, you would be disappointed. 

First, you have to tell your VM to use the new VM image. 

Second, you have to tell your VM's operating system to use the additional space
you just gave it.

Use the new cloned VM image
---------------------------

Close the Virtual Media Manager window. In the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager
main window, single-click on the "machine1" virtual machine, and select
Settings.

In the Machine1 - Settings window, on the left-side menu, select Storage.

You will see two VDI files listed under Storage devices:
    machine1.vdi (attached)
    machine2.vdi (not attached)

First, attach machine2.vdi by right-clicking it and selecting "attach" or
"Add Attachment", whatever it says.

Second, un-attach machine1.vdi by right-clicking it and selecting "detach"
or "unattach" or "Remove Attachment", whatever it says.

Click OK to close the Settings window.

Now double-click on the "machine1" virtual machine to start it up.

Adjusting the partition size
----------------------------

After you've logged into your virtual machine, you need to install and run
a partition manager. An easy Linux one is a graphics-based one called 
Gparted.

Do whatever you need to do in your Linux system to install and open GParted.

The partition manager will show you the main hard disk. In Linux, it's
probably called /dev/sda1. The partition manager will show you that the
disk capacity is some big number, but that the partition is a much smaller
number. 

Select the partion, right-click, and choose Resize/Move. Then adjust the
partition so that it uses all of the new space you just gave it.

Click Ok, Accept, Apply, whatever it takes to set the new partition size and
close Gparted.

You're done!
