Sharing files between VM and regular PC
=======================================

Once you get the share setup on the VM, you can find it in the /media
directory.

For example, the shared directory on the host PC FW-20020 is 
   c:\Users\rdepew\Documents\share
and on the VM bierstadt-dev2 it's
   /media/sf_share.
