# The X server in MobaXterm


## On remote systems

The X server in MobaXterm lets you run graphics-based programs on
remote systems in X windows on your local PC. Just ssh to the
remote system and execute the command, like 'xclock' (everybody's
favorite X demo)or 'gitk' or 'wireshark' or even 'firefox'.


## On your local system

MobaXterm / Cygwin has a limited set of graphical programs that you
can install locally. They're listed at

    https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/plugins.html 

and you install them by typing
```
apt-get install <the_program_name>
```

The first time you install a graphical program, it will take a
while to install all of the X dependencies. I mean, like, a
half-hour. And you will have to do some fiddlign with the
configurations to get the Cygwin/MobaXterm version to look like the
native Windows version.


## Xclock and others that aren't listed 

If you don't see a program listed at that webpage, try running and
installing it anyway. For example, you can try running `xclock`.
MobaXterm will tell you that it's not installed and suggest you try
installing it. Install it using
```
apt-get install xclock
```
... and then try running it again. It will work.
