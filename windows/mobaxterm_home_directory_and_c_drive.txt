Where's the MobaXterm home directory?
=====================================

That's a really good question. In Windows, it's in your Documents directory:

    Documents > MobaXterm > home 

While we're at it, MobaXterm's "root directory" is also in your Documents 
directory:

    Documents > MobaXterm > slash

From the Windows command line, they are at:

    C:\Users\rdepew\Documents\MobaXterm\home
    C:\Users\rdepew\Documents\MobaXterm\slash

Where's the C drive, from inside MobaXterm?
===========================================

MobaXterm is descended from Cygwin. So the old Cygwin location works:

    /cygdrive/c

... but MobaXterm has its own location, which works just as well:

    /drives/c

Both locations point to your C: drive. Naturally, you can substitute
other drive letters for other drives.
