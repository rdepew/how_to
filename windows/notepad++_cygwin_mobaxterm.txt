How to start Notepad++ from Cygwin (or MobaXterm) command line
==============================================================

(From https://superuser.com/questions/607379/how-do-i-start-notepad-from-cmd)

Suppose you're using Cygwin and you want to run Notepad++.

Regular Notepad is easy: just type 'notepad'.

Notepad++ isn't that easy, though. But there's a way-cool workaround.

You know how you can run any program by entering the program name in the 
Windows "Type here to search" field and hitting Enter?

Well, from the *Windows* command line, you can do the same thing by typing
'start <program_name>'.

Cygwin has its own version of 'start', called 'cygstart'. So in Cygwin, type
'cygstart <program_name>'.

And MobaXterm includes Cygwin, so 'cygstart' works in MobaXterm as well.
Exclamation point!

SO....

If you want to run notepad++ from Cygwin or MobaXterm:
'cygstart notepad++'

You can also open a file in Notepad++ by typing:
'cygstart nodepad++ <filename>'

LATE-BREAKING NEWS:
'cygstart' is aliased to 'open'. So it's easier to remember:

'open notepad++ <filename>'
