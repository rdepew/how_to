# Cygstart and open

Cygwin (and MobaXterm) has this cool tool called 'cygstart'. You
can start any Windows program at the Cygwin command prompt using
'cygstart', like this:

    $ cygstart notepad++

But it's even better than that. The keyword `open` is aliased to
`/bin/cygstart.exe`, so you can start a Windows program like this:

    $ open notepad++

Two cautions:
1. You have to know the program name. Usually it's the name of the
  .exe file.
2. If the program's directory isn't in the Windows PATH, you'll 
  need to 'cd' to the directory first, or else specify the full 
  pathname in the `open` command.

But it gets even better. 'open' can call the appropriate Windows
program for files, URLS, and lots of other things. Here are some
great examples:

    $ open UserGuide.pdf
    $ open gvim testprogram.py
    $ open testprogram.py        # runs it in a new window
    $ open "A Word file.docx"
    $ open http://google.com
    $ open /drives/c/Users/rdepew/Downloads
    $ open ncpa.cpl

See `open --help` for more options. Cygstart is a very powerful
tool.
