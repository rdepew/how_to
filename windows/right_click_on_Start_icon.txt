Right-clicking on the Start icon
================================

Wow. Why didn't I discover this earlier? A lot of the Windows sysadmin
tools, things that are second nature in Linux, show up this menu. There
are other ways to get to these tools, but this is the easiest way yet.

Try it. Right-click on on the Windows 10 Start icon. Here's what you get:

Apps and Features - the old "Add and Remove Programs" tool.
Mobility Center - useful tools for moving your laptop PC around.
Power Options - eh
Event viewer - eh 
System - the summary / title page that WinXP used to display so nicely.
Device Manager
Network Connections - you need this to fix Network Sharing.
Disk Management - disk partitioning, etc. Doesn't work very well on my PC.
Computer Management - combines some of the other tools
Windows PowerShell
Task Manager
Settings
File Explorer
Search
Run
Shut down or sign out
Desktop (same as Win-M or Win-D)
