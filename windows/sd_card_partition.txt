How to delete partitions on an SD card
======================================

Sometimes when you borrow an SD card, you find that it already has
partitions on it that limit the amount of space you can use. Here's 
how to reclaim that missing space.


Method 1: The Windows Disk Management tool
------------------------------------------

Open the Disk Managment tool by typing in the Run field: diskmgmt.msc. (Or
you can right-click on the Start icon and choose Disk Management from the
menu.)

Right click the partition you want to delete and then click Delete Volume.

But sometimes the Delete Volume option is greyed out. In that case, try
something else. Bummer.

Method 2: DiskPart
-------------------

Open the Disk Partitioning tool by typing in the Run field: diskpart

When it asks if you want to allow it to make changes, click Yes.

At the diskpart prompt, type 'list disk'.

Type 'select disk n', where n is the disk where you plan to delete the
partition.

Type 'list partition'.

Type 'select partition n', where n is the partition you want to delete.

Type 'delete partition'.

Done.

Method2a: DiskPart again
------------------------

After 'select disk n', type 'clean'. This should clean everything off the
SD card. DANGER! It really will. Erases EVERTYHING.

Then type 'create partition primary'. This creates a partition on your SD
card. You have to do this step, or the entire card will be "unallocated".


Method 3: SD Card Formatter
---------------------------

Download and install the SD Card Organization's official SD card formatter
tool from
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/eula_windows/index.html .

Method 4: Linux! This one always works
--------------------------------------

Use the Linux 'parted' tool. See the file how_to/linux/sd_cards_and_linux.txt .
